If you don't like the new quirks, delete the mechs.json in this folder and remove the .back from the other mechs.json. This will remove the references CI has for the vast majority of mechs, while keeping the scaling intact.

If you prefer the quirks from a seperate mod, either throw its mechs.json into the resources folder for CI, or move it higher in your load order. (WARNING: CHANGING LOAD ORDER MAY CAUSE OTHER ISSUES)

If you don't like a quirk or two specifically, open the quirks.json folder, ctrl+f --> name of the quirk you don't like --> edit it however you like.
