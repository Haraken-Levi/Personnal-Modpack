These settings have been moved to game.ini (use Bobbert's Mod Options to access them from in-game GUI).

Ini file default settings. If you break something, just delete the ini and the mod will re-create it with default settings at next run.
Settings will only apply during mission. Mechlab will still show the normal / vanilla values.

Explanation:
GlobalOptimalRangeMultiplier(float):1.0 - this is the normal / optimal range of the weapon - it does 100% damage. Setting a value of 2.0 will increase weapon ranges to double.
Applies to: all weapons

GlobalMaxRangeMultiplier(float):1.5 - this is the maximum range of the weapons. Calculated by multiplying optimal range. MW5 default is 1.5, MWO default is 2.0.
Exceptions: vanilla ballistic weapons have no max range, only Optimal. AI will only fire them in optimal range. PPCs have 2.0 as default max range. If GlobalMaxRange is smaller than 2, PPCs will have 2. If higher than 2, PPCs will have that value. TAGs have no maximum range. Gauss weapons will have (optimal range * maxrange * 1.5). So 2.0 set as global max range, Gauss will have an actual 3.0 max range. Pulse lasers have different balancing in vanilla, that will be overridden as well.
Applies to: all weapons except missiles

GlobalProjectileVelocityMultiplier(float):1.0 - velocity of all ballistic projectiles (ppcs, autocannons, gauss, except missiles). MW5 is 1.0, MWO has around 1.25 or so (velocities got nerfed in MW5).
Applies to: projectile weapons, PPCs

GlobalDamageScaleAtMaxRange(float):0.2 - damage done at maximum range. MW5 default for PPCs and energy weapons is 0.2, MWO is 0.0. Autocannons and Gauss no damage drop (set BallisticDamageFalloff to 1 if you want this to apply).
Applies to: all weapons except missiles

BallisticDamageMultiplier(float):1.0 - damage done by ballistic / projectile weapons (PPCs, autocannons, gauss, missiles).
Applies to: projectile weapons, PPCs, missiles

BallisticHeatGeneratedMultiplier(float):1.0 - heat per shot of ballistic / projectile / missile weapons.
Applies to: projectile weapons, PPCs, missiles

BallisticDamageFalloffYesNo(boolean):0 - MW5 has no damage falloff / damage drop / max range for gauss and autocannon weapons. If you enable this (set to 1), they will have those too. Must be set to 1 to have ballistic weapons max range and damage scale. PPCs always have damage drop.
Applies to: projectile weapons except PPCs

TraceDamageMultiplier(float):1.0 - damage done by trace weapons (lasers, flamers, machine guns).
Applies to: lasers, flamers, machineguns

TraceHeatDamageMultiplier(float):1.0 - heat damage done by trace weapons (in this case, only flamers)
Applies to: lasers, flamers, machineguns

TraceHeatGeneratedMultiplier(float):1.0 - heat generated by trace weapons.
Applies to: lasers, flamers, machineguns

TracePulseLaserDurationMultiplier(float):1.0 - modifies the duration of all Pulse Lasers. 0.5 means half duration.
Applies to: lasers, flamers, machineguns

DisableCoodownWoopWoopYesNo(bool):1 - if yes, turns off the annoying cooldown report sounds.
Applies to: all weapons that use vanilla WeaponCooldownComponent, or its child as cooldown component (add call: Parent: Begin Play).

MissileDestroyMaxRange(bool):0 - if 1, missiles will self-destruct when reaching max range. If 0, missiles will drop as in vanilla game (including MRMs).

DisableArtillery(bool):0 - if 1, artillery weapons will not spawn on markets (intro date: 9999). If 0, they spawn normally.
